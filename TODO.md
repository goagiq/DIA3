## Summary of Recent Fixes

### Latest Fix: Interactive Visualizations in Strategic Template âœ…
**Problem**: The strategic template was missing all interactive visualization sections and tooltips, only showing basic sections.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Added All Missing Sections**: Updated strategic template to include all 16 interactive visualization sections:
   - Interactive Visualizations (Enhanced Data Visualization, Strategic Trends)
   - Strategic Analysis (Strategic Analysis Overview, Strategic Insights)
   - Enhanced Data Analysis (Enhanced Data Analysis Overview, Key Data Metrics)
   - Acquisition Programs & Modernization (Acquisition Timeline, Modernization Progress)
   - Forecasting & Predictive Analytics (Strategic Forecasts, Predictive Models)
   - Operational Considerations (Operational Readiness, Capability Assessment)
   - Regional Security Dynamics (Regional Security Index, Security Dynamics)
   - Economic Cost Analysis (Cost Breakdown, Financial Impact)
   - Implementation Timeline (Implementation Timeline, Key Milestones)
   - Comparison Analysis & Strategic Options (Strategic Options Comparison, Options Analysis)
   - Advanced Forecasting Analysis (Advanced Forecasts, Scenario Analysis)
   - Forecast Model Performance Comparison (Model Performance, Accuracy Comparison)
   - Strategic Capability Forecasts (5-Year Horizon) (Capability Forecast, Strategic Planning)
   - Predictive Analytics & Feature Importance (Predictive Analytics, Feature Importance)
   - Scenario Prediction Analysis (Scenario Predictions, Prediction Analysis)
   - Risk Assessment Matrix (Comprehensive risk assessment table)

2. **Enhanced Tooltip System**: Added comprehensive tooltip functionality with:
   - Source references and confidence scores
   - Strategic analysis and recommendations
   - Use cases and implementation guidance
   - Interactive hover effects

3. **Chart Integration**: Integrated all chart scripts and enhanced tooltip callbacks

**Result**: Strategic reports now have the same comprehensive interactive visualizations as comprehensive reports, with full tooltip functionality and intelligence-enhanced recommendations.

## Current Status

âœ… **All Interactive Visualizations Working**: Both comprehensive and strategic templates now include all interactive visualization sections with enhanced tooltips.

âœ… **Intelligence Recommendations Working**: Strategic recommendations section now shows detailed intelligence analysis with confidence scores and timelines.

ðŸ”„ **Next Steps**: Complete remaining MCP integration, vision model implementation, and final testing.
