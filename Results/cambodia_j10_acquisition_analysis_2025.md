## 8. Conclusion and Strategic Outlook

### 8.1 Key Strategic Implications

**Power Projection:**
Cambodia's acquisition of 50 J-10 fighter jets provides unprecedented air power projection capabilities, fundamentally altering the country's strategic position in Southeast Asia. This represents a significant shift from a minor regional player to a mid-tier regional power with substantial conventional deterrence capabilities.

**Regional Balance:**
The acquisition creates a significant shift in regional military balance, favoring China-aligned states and challenging the traditional dominance of US allies in the region. This shift will likely trigger responses from neighboring states and major powers, potentially leading to an arms race and increased regional tensions.

**Economic Dependencies:**
The acquisition strengthens economic ties between Cambodia and China while potentially reducing economic relationships with the United States and other Western powers. This creates new economic dependencies and leverage opportunities for China while reducing Western influence in the region.

**Diplomatic Realignment:**
Cambodia's acquisition signals a diplomatic realignment toward China and away from the United States and its allies. This realignment will likely manifest in voting patterns in international organizations, diplomatic support for Chinese positions, and reduced cooperation with Western initiatives.

### 8.2 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**High-Risk Factors:**
- **Regional Arms Race**: High probability of regional arms race escalation
- **Border Tensions**: Medium probability of border tensions and conflicts
- **Great Power Competition**: Medium probability of proxy competition
- **Economic Instability**: Low probability of economic instability

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Confidence-Building**: Implement comprehensive confidence-building measures

### 8.4 Policy Recommendations

**For Regional Stability:**
1. **Immediate**: Establish confidence-building measures and communication channels
