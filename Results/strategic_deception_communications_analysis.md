## Core Monitoring Principles

### 1. The Deception Detection Paradigm

**Fundamental Principle**: "兵者，詭道也" - "War is the way of deception"

Strategic deception in communications operates on multiple levels:
- **Tactical Level**: Immediate misdirection and false signaling
- **Operational Level**: Coordinated campaigns across multiple channels
- **Strategic Level**: Long-term influence operations and perception management

### 2. Information Asymmetry Analysis

Key indicators of strategic deception include:
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Deliberate withholding of critical information
- **Selective Disclosure**: Controlled release of information to shape perceptions
- **Timing Anomalies**: Strategic timing of communications that align with objectives
- **Channel Coordination**: Synchronized messaging across multiple platforms
