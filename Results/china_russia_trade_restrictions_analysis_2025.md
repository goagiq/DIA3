## Conclusion

The analysis indicates that new trade restrictions will have significant but manageable impacts on China-Russia trade relations over the next 2 years. While immediate disruptions are expected, both countries have demonstrated resilience and adaptation capabilities that will likely lead to new equilibrium states.

Key success factors include:
- Rapid development of alternative payment systems
- Accelerated domestic technology development
- Strategic diversification of trade partnerships
- Enhanced environmental policy implementation

The seasonal pattern analysis reveals that agricultural and energy trade will be most affected, while technology transfer restrictions will drive innovation in both countries. Anomaly detection systems will be crucial for identifying and responding to unusual trade patterns as both countries adapt to the new restrictions.
