- **Resource Requirements**: Specific resource needs (personnel, equipment, budget)
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites that must be satisfied before execution
- **Timeline Position**: Relative position in the operation timeline (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Risk Level**: Categorical risk assessment (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

## Analysis Results

### Critical Path Analysis

The most common successful execution paths identified:

1. **Primary Path**: Intelligence → Target Selection → Resource Allocation → Planning → Execution → Extraction
2. **Alternative Path**: Intelligence → Target Selection → Resource Allocation → Planning → Execution (with contingency extraction)

### Risk Metrics

#### Time-Based Risk
- **Successful Operations Average Time**: 18.5 days
- **Failed Operations Average Time**: 12.3 days
- **Time Variance**: 4.2 days

#### Resource Risk
- **Personnel**: Average consumption 85%, Max consumption 95%
- **Equipment**: Average consumption 78%, Max consumption 92%
- **Budget**: Average consumption 72%, Max consumption 88%

## Strategic Implications

### Operational Planning

1. **Resource Allocation**: Current resource allocation is insufficient for high-risk decision points
2. **Timeline Management**: Operation timeline may be too compressed for complex decision chains
3. **Contingency Planning**: Insufficient backup plans for critical failure points

### Risk Management

1. **Critical Point Focus**: Concentrate resources on the three identified critical decision points
2. **Dependency Management**: Strengthen intelligence gathering to support target selection
3. **Resource Buffering**: Maintain 15-20% resource buffer for unexpected requirements

### Decision Support

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring of decision point progress
2. **Early Warning Systems**: Develop indicators for potential decision point failures
3. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Enable rapid resource reallocation based on real-time needs
