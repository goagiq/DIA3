- API endpoint testing with real HTTP requests
- Art of War integration verification
- Strategic recommendation generation testing
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Strategic Analysis Framework

### **Art of War Integration:**

The system applies Art of War principles to each domain:

**Strategic Ambiguity** (能而示之不能):
- Business: Maintain competitive advantages while appearing modest
- Defense: Maintain military capabilities while appearing defensive
- Intelligence: Maintain operational security while gathering intelligence

**Information Asymmetry** (用而示之不用):
- Business: Pursue market opportunities quietly while competitors focus elsewhere
- Defense: Gather intelligence while protecting own information
- Intelligence: Create information advantages through superior collection

**Psychological Positioning** (卑而驕之):
- Business: Position as collaborative partner rather than aggressive competitor
- Defense: Build alliances while maintaining strategic independence
- Intelligence: Build trust with sources while maintaining operational security

### **Strategic Recommendations:**

The system generates domain-specific recommendations with:
- **Priority levels**: high, medium, low
- **Timeframes**: immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term
- **Impact scores**: 0.0 to 1.0 scale
- **Implementation difficulty**: easy, moderate, difficult
- **Resource requirements**: detailed lists of needed resources
- **Success metrics**: measurable outcomes for tracking progress

## Technical Implementation

### **Architecture:**
- **Modular Design**: Domain-specific templates and frameworks
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new domains and analysis types
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies
- **Async Support**: Full async/await support for scalability
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **Integration Points:**
- **Vector Database**: Content storage and retrieval
- **Knowledge Graph**: Analysis result storage and relationship mapping
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol integration
- **FastAPI**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

## Usage Examples

### **Business Strategic Analysis:**
```python
result = await analyzer.analyze_strategic_position(
    content="Analyze our business strategic position in current market conditions",
    domain=DomainType.BUSINESS,
    analysis_type=AnalysisType.COMPREHENSIVE,
    include_art_of_war=True,
    include_recommendations=True

    analysis_type=AnalysisType.RISK,
    include_art_of_war=True,
    include_recommendations=True
)
```

### **Intelligence Deception Analysis:**
```python
result = await analyzer.analyze_strategic_position(
    content="Analyze our intelligence capabilities including deception detection",
