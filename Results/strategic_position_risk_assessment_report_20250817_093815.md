## Methodology

### Monte Carlo Simulation Parameters

- **Iterations**: 10,000
- **Confidence Level**: 95%
- **Distribution Type**: Beta distributions for realistic uncertainty modeling
- **Risk Calculation**: Inverse of strategic strength score

### Historical Data Sources

- **Art of War**: Sun Tzu's strategic principles and historical examples
- **War and Peace**: Tolstoy's analysis of Napoleon's Russian campaign
- **Classical Histories**: Herodotus and other classical sources

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of our current strategic position using Monte Carlo simulation and historical strategic outcomes from classical literature. The results should inform strategic planning and risk mitigation efforts.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and validate the strategic position assessment
2. Implement priority recommendations
3. Establish monitoring mechanisms for key risk indicators
4. Conduct regular reassessment using this framework
