- **intelligence_gap_analysis**
- **strategic_positioning_analysis**
- **optimal_strategy_identification**
- **multi_source_intelligence_fusion**
- **capability_development_planning**
- **threat_evolution_modeling**
- **trend_analysis**
- **predictive_analysis**
- **technology_investment_assessment**
- **course_of_action_analysis**
- **capability_assessment_analysis**
- **intent_analysis**
- **operational_risk_analysis**

### Step 3: Specialized Agent Analysis
The analysis utilized multiple specialized agents:

- **Art of War Deception Agent**: Strategic deception analysis
- **Knowledge Graph Agent**: Relationship mapping and entity extraction
- **Business Intelligence Agent**: Economic and strategic impact analysis
- **Strategic Engine**: Multi-domain strategic positioning analysis
