   - Patterns: "discontinue while continue", "withdraw unofficial"

3. **近而示之遠 (Show Distance When Near)**
   - Detects: Claims of distance while being involved
   - Patterns: "distant while close", "uninterested while involved"

4. **遠而示之近 (Show Nearness When Far)**
   - Detects: Claims of close involvement while being distant
   - Patterns: "close while distant", "control while limited"

5. **利而誘之 (Lure with Profit)**
   - Detects: Overly generous offers with hidden conditions
   - Patterns: "generous offer", "too good to be true"
