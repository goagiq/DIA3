## Image Generation

The actual PNG images were generated using the `generate_mermaid_images.py` script, which uses the mermaid.ink web service to convert Mermaid diagram code into PNG images. All 12 diagrams have been successfully generated and are properly embedded in the whitepaper.

The images include:
- System architecture diagrams
- Process flowcharts
- Analysis frameworks
- Forecasting charts
- Decision support tools
- Risk assessment matrices

You can view all images in the `demo_images.html` file for a visual overview.

## Usage

The whitepaper is designed for:
- **Senior Decision Makers** - Executive summary and strategic implications
- **Intelligence Analysts** - Detailed methodology and implementation guidance
- **Strategic Planners** - Framework categories and decision support tools
- **Technical Teams** - System architecture and implementation resources
