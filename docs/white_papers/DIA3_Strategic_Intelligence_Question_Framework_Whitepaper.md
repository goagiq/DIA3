**Narrative**: The decision tree analysis begins with a strategic decision point, typically involving adversary intent assessment. The tree branches based on key questions such as whether adversary intent is clear, capability assessment levels, strategic position evaluation, and resource availability. Each branch leads to specific actions including conducting intent analysis, monitoring developments, repositioning forces, executing strategies, or optimizing resources. The decision tree ensures that all possible scenarios are considered systematically, with clear decision criteria and action paths for each branch. This structured approach prevents decision paralysis and ensures that all factors are considered before taking action. The tree can be expanded to include additional decision points and branches as complexity increases, providing a scalable framework for decision support.

### Risk Assessment Matrix

The risk assessment matrix provides a visual framework for evaluating and prioritizing risks based on probability and impact.

![Risk Assessment Matrix](./images/risk_assessment_matrix.png)

**Narrative**: The risk assessment matrix combines probability levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low) with impact levels (Catastrophic, Major, Moderate, Minor, Insignificant) to create risk zones. Critical risks requiring immediate action are identified in the high probability/high impact zone, while high risks requiring priority management fall in the medium-high probability/major impact area. Medium risks requiring close monitoring are in the moderate probability/moderate impact zone, while low risks that can be accepted with monitoring fall in the lower probability/impact areas. Minimal risks that can be accepted are in the very low probability/insignificant impact zone. This matrix enables systematic risk prioritization and resource allocation, ensuring that the most critical risks receive appropriate attention and resources. The matrix can be customized for different domains and scenarios, providing a consistent framework for risk assessment across all intelligence analysis activities.
