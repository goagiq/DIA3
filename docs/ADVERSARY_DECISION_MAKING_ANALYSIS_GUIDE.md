## 1. Methodology Overview

### 1.1 Integrated Analysis Approach

The adversary decision-making analysis combines three complementary methodologies:

1. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probabilistic modeling of adversary capabilities and decision factors
2. **Art of War Principles**: Classical strategic analysis using Sun Tzu's five fundamentals
3. **Decision Tree Analysis**: Structured modeling of adversary strategic choices

### 1.2 Key Components

- **Capability Assessment**: Military, economic, and political capabilities
- **Risk Tolerance Analysis**: Adversary willingness to accept strategic risks
- **Decision Timeline Modeling**: Expected timeframes for strategic decisions
- **Strategic Objective Mapping**: Identification of adversary goals and motivations

---

## 2. Monte Carlo Simulation Framework

### 2.1 Log-Normal Distribution Modeling

The analysis uses log-normal distributions to model realistic capability growth patterns:

```python
# Capability parameters by adversary type
regional_power = {
    "military": {"mu": 0.7, "sigma": 0.2},
    "economic": {"mu": 0.6, "sigma": 0.25},
    "political": {"mu": 0.5, "sigma": 0.3}
}

cyber_adversary = {
    "military": {"mu": 0.3, "sigma": 0.2},
    "economic": {"mu": 0.4, "sigma": 0.3},
    "political": {"mu": 0.6, "sigma": 0.25}
}
```

### 2.2 Decision-Making Factors

The simulation models three critical decision-making factors:

1. **Risk Tolerance** (0-1 scale): Adversary willingness to accept strategic risks
2. **Decision Speed** (months): Time required for strategic decision-making
3. **Resource Commitment** (0-1 scale): Level of resource allocation to objectives

### 2.3 Confidence Intervals

Analysis provides 95% confidence intervals for all probabilistic assessments, ensuring robust uncertainty quantification.

## 5. Results Interpretation

### 5.1 Threat Level Assessment

**HIGH Threat Indicators:**
- Overall effectiveness > 1.5
- Multiple capability areas > 1.8
- Strong command and method scores
- High risk tolerance (> 0.7)

**MEDIUM Threat Indicators:**
- Overall effectiveness 1.0-1.5
- Mixed capability scores
- Moderate risk tolerance (0.4-0.7)
- Some organizational weaknesses

**LOW Threat Indicators:**
- Overall effectiveness < 1.0
- Multiple capability weaknesses
- Low risk tolerance (< 0.4)

### 5.2 Decision Tree Analysis

The analysis generates probability-weighted decision trees:

```
Root Decision: Strategic Initiative Launch
├── Aggressive Approach (High Risk)
│   ├── Probability: Risk tolerance × 0.8
│   ├── Timeline: Decision speed × 0.8
│   └── Expected outcome: 0.7
├── Moderate Approach (Medium Risk)
│   ├── Probability: (1 - Risk tolerance) × 0.6
│   ├── Timeline: Decision speed
│   └── Expected outcome: 0.6
└── Defensive Approach (Low Risk)
    ├── Probability: (1 - Risk tolerance) × 0.4
    ├── Timeline: Decision speed × 0.8
    └── Expected outcome: 0.5
```

### 5.3 Risk Tolerance Calculation
