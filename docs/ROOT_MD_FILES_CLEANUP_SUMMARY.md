# Root .md Files Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup and reorganization of .md files that were previously located in the project root directory.

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### Files Moved to `docs/`
- **MONTE_CARLO_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md** → `docs/MONTE_CARLO_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md`
  - **Reason**: Comprehensive implementation documentation belongs in the docs directory
  - **Content**: 524 lines of Monte Carlo simulation implementation tracking and progress

### Files Moved to `Test/`
- **MONTE_CARLO_TEST_SCENARIOS.md** → `Test/MONTE_CARLO_TEST_SCENARIOS.md`
  - **Reason**: Test scenarios and testing documentation belongs in the Test directory
  - **Content**: 539 lines of Monte Carlo test scenarios for Intelligence Community & DoD applications

### Files Moved to `docs/summaries/`
- **PHASE7_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md** → `docs/summaries/PHASE7_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
  - **Reason**: Phase summaries belong in the summaries subdirectory for better organization
  - **Content**: 248 lines of Phase 7 integration summary and status

- **PHASE_6_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** → `docs/summaries/PHASE_6_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
  - **Reason**: Phase summaries belong in the summaries subdirectory for better organization
  - **Content**: 180 lines of Phase 6 Monte Carlo visualization implementation summary

### Files Deleted
- **PHASE_7_FINAL_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md**
  - **Reason**: Empty file (only 2 lines with no content)
  - **Action**: Deleted to reduce clutter

- **PHASE_7_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md**
  - **Reason**: Empty file (only 2 lines with no content)
  - **Action**: Deleted to reduce clutter

### Files Kept in Root
- **README.md**
  - **Reason**: Main project documentation that should remain accessible from the root directory
  - **Content**: 621 lines of comprehensive project overview, architecture, and setup instructions

## Result
After cleanup, only the main `README.md` file remains in the project root directory, providing a clean and organized project structure.

## Benefits
1. **Better Organization**: Files are now located in appropriate directories based on their content and purpose
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory is now cleaner with only essential documentation
3. **Improved Navigation**: Users can easily find documentation in logical locations
4. **Consistent Structure**: Follows the existing project organization patterns
