## Early Warning Indicators

### 1. Linguistic Deception Indicators

**Evasive Language Patterns:**
- Excessive qualifiers: "perhaps," "maybe," "possibly"
- Vague responses: "not sure," "don't know," "can't say"
- Generalizations: "generally," "usually," "typically"
- Ambiguous references: "some," "several," "many"

**Overqualification Patterns:**
- Unnecessary truth claims: "to be honest," "frankly," "truthfully"
- Excessive detail for simple questions
- Redundant confirmations

### 2. Strategic Deception Indicators

**Misdirection Techniques:**
- "Appear weak when strong, appear strong when weak"
- Hidden agendas behind straightforward proposals
- Simultaneous cooperative and aggressive actions
- Information operations creating false perceptions

**False Urgency Indicators:**
- Artificial deadlines and pressure tactics
- "Limited time offers" without justification
- Sudden changes in urgency levels

### 3. Cultural Deception Patterns

**Chinese Strategic Deception:**
- Indirect communication patterns
- Face-saving mechanisms
- Strategic ambiguity in negotiations

**Russian Strategic Deception:**
- Information warfare techniques
- Hybrid warfare indicators
- Strategic misdirection in diplomacy

### 4. Behavioral Inconsistency Indicators

**Emotional Inconsistencies:**
- Mismatched emotional expressions
- Sudden emotional shifts
- Inconsistent emotional responses

**Commitment Inconsistencies:**
- Contradictory statements over time
- Inconsistent follow-through
- Changing positions without explanation

### 5. Temporal Deception Patterns

**Time-Based Manipulation:**
- Strategic timing of announcements
- Delayed information disclosure
- Temporal inconsistencies in narratives

## Monitoring Requirements

### Data Sources
- **Diplomatic Communications**: Official statements, negotiations, treaties
- **Economic Indicators**: Trade data, financial flows, market movements
- **Military Activities**: Force movements, exercises, deployments
- **Information Operations**: Media campaigns, social media, propaganda
- **Business Intelligence**: Corporate communications, market analysis

### Analysis Methods
- **Cross-Source Verification**: Compare information across multiple sources
- **Temporal Analysis**: Track changes over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring deception techniques
- **Cultural Context Analysis**: Consider cultural communication patterns
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor consistency in actions and statements

## Usage Examples

### Defense Domain
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8003/strategic-deception/defense/monitor", json={
    "content": "Our military capabilities are limited and we pose no threat...",
    "monitoring_level": "comprehensive",
    "alert_threshold": 0.6
})
```

### Business Domain
```python
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8003/strategic-deception/business/monitor", json={
    "content": "This deal expires tomorrow and everyone knows it's the best opportunity...",
    "monitoring_level": "standard",
    "alert_threshold": 0.7
})
```

### Batch Processing
```python
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8003/strategic-deception/monitor-batch", json={
    "contents": [
        "Content 1 with potential deception indicators...",
        "Content 2 with different patterns...",
        "Content 3 for comparison..."
    ],
    "domain": "intelligence",
    "parallel_processing": True
})
```

- **Information Theory**: Mathematical deception detection models

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: MCP server not accessible
**Solution**: Check if MCP server is running and properly mounted

**Issue**: "MCP client cannot call mcp tools"
**Solution**: See `docs/MCP_SERVER_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` - most common cause is standalone MCP server not actually starting

**Issue**: Strategic deception monitoring returns errors
**Solution**: Verify orchestrator is initialized and agents are registered

**Issue**: High processing times
**Solution**: Check system resources and optimize batch processing

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:8003/health

# Check MCP server health
