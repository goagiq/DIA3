## Executive Summary

Strategic misdirection is a fundamental principle of conflict described in Sun Tzu's *The Art of War*: "兵者，詭道也" (War is the way of deception). This framework provides a comprehensive methodology for identifying when adversaries are employing these ancient techniques in modern contexts.

### Key Detection Principles:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring deception techniques across different domains
2. **Information Asymmetry Analysis**: Detect when knowledge gaps are being exploited
3. **Behavioral Inconsistency**: Spot contradictions between public statements and private actions
4. **Cultural Intelligence**: Understand how cultural factors influence deception strategies
5. **Technical Verification**: Use modern tools to validate or refute claims
