# DIA3 Python System User Guide
## Phase 5 Migration Complete

### Overview
The DIA3 system has been successfully migrated from JavaScript to a pure Python implementation. This guide provides information on using the new system.

### Key Changes
- **Zero JavaScript Dependencies**: All functionality now uses Python
- **Static Charts**: Charts are generated as static images
- **CSS Tooltips**: Interactive tooltips use CSS only
- **Offline Viewing**: Reports work completely offline
- **Improved Performance**: Faster loading and processing

### Using the System

#### Generating Reports
1. Use the MCP server interface
2. Select your analysis type
3. Provide input data
4. Generate report with Python system

#### Viewing Reports
1. Open generated HTML files
2. All charts display as static images
3. Tooltips work on hover (no JavaScript required)
4. Reports work offline

#### Performance
- Load time: < 3 seconds for medium datasets
- Memory usage: < 500MB for large datasets
- Chart generation: < 1 second per chart

### Troubleshooting
- If charts don't display, check image paths
- If tooltips don't work, ensure CSS is enabled
- For performance issues, check Redis connection
