## Integration with Existing Systems

### MCP Server Integration

The strategic analysis system can be integrated with existing MCP servers:

```python
# Example integration with existing MCP tools
from mcp_servers.strategic_analysis_server import StrategicAnalysisEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = StrategicAnalysisEngine()

# Use with existing MCP tools
async def analyze_strategic_situation(data, domain):
    assessment = engine.conduct_strategic_assessment(data, domain)
    return assessment
```

### API Integration

```python
# REST API integration example
import requests

def get_strategic_assessment(data, domain):
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/strategic-analysis/assess",
        json={"data": data, "domain": domain}
    )
    return response.json()
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Quality
- Ensure all metrics are properly normalized (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
- Use consistent measurement methodologies across domains
- Validate data accuracy and completeness before analysis

### 2. Domain-Specific Considerations
- Adjust metric weights based on organizational priorities
- Consider cultural and contextual factors in analysis
- Regularly update risk thresholds based on changing conditions

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- Collect feedback on recommendation effectiveness
- Update predictive models with new data
- Refine domain configurations based on experience

### 4. Security and Privacy
- Implement appropriate access controls for sensitive data
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations
- Protect strategic analysis results appropriately

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure src directory is in Python path
   export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/src"
   ```

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install required packages
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn mcp
   ```

3. **Domain Configuration Issues**
   - Verify domain enum values match expected strings
   - Check that all required metrics are provided
   - Ensure metric values are within 0.0-1.0 range

### Performance Optimization

1. **Large Datasets**
   - Use batch processing for multiple assessments
