# Strategic Assessment Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful integration of strategic assessment capabilities into the main DIA3 system, including Art of War deception analysis and comprehensive strategic assessment functionality.

## Integration Components

### 1. Core Fixes Applied

#### UnifiedTextAgent Fix
- **Issue**: Missing `process_content` method that MCP server was trying to call
- **Fix**: Added `process_content` method to `src/agents/unified_text_agent.py` that delegates to existing `process_text` method
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### VectorDBManager Fix
- **Issue**: Missing `store_document` method that Art of War deception agent was trying to call
- **Fix**: Added `store_document` method to `src/core/vector_db.py` with proper parameter handling
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Art of War Deception Agent Fix
- **Issue**: Incorrect await usage on non-async `report_manager.save_report` method
- **Fix**: Removed await from `report_manager.save_report` call in `src/agents/art_of_war_deception_agent.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Main System Integration

#### main.py Updates
- Added strategic assessment initialization function
- Integrated Art of War deception agent and vector database initialization
- Updated MCP server tool descriptions to include strategic analysis tools
