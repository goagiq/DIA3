# Tooltip HTML Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The user reported that "The tooltip has html tag in them" - meaning that HTML tags were being displayed literally in the tooltips instead of being rendered as HTML.

## Root Cause
The tooltip JavaScript was using `textContent` to set the tooltip content, which treats HTML as plain text and displays the tags literally.

## Solution Implemented
Changed `tooltipContent.textContent = data.content;` to `tooltipContent.innerHTML = data.content;` in both tooltip JavaScript functions in `src/core/enhanced_html_report_generator.py`.

### Files Modified
- `src/core/enhanced_html_report_generator.py` - Fixed tooltip JavaScript to use `innerHTML` instead of `textContent`

### Changes Made
1. **Enhanced Tooltip Function** (around line 1701):
   ```javascript
   // Before
   tooltipContent.textContent = data.content;
   
   // After  
   tooltipContent.innerHTML = data.content;
   ```

2. **Simple Tooltip Function** (around line 1978):
   ```javascript
   // Before
   tooltipContent.textContent = data.content;
   
   // After
   tooltipContent.innerHTML = data.content;
   ```

## Testing
Created and ran `Test/test_tooltip_html_fix.py` to verify the fix:

### Test Results
✅ **Tooltip HTML rendering test passed!** - Confirmed that `innerHTML` is used instead of `textContent`
✅ **HTML content preservation test passed!** - Confirmed that tooltip content is generated properly
✅ **Test report generated successfully** - Generated a sample report with the fix
✅ **Generated HTML contains correct tooltip implementation!** - Verified the fix is applied in generated reports

## Impact
- **Before**: HTML tags like `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a href="">` were displayed literally in tooltips
- **After**: HTML tags are now properly rendered, making tooltips more professional and readable

## Current Status
- ✅ Tooltip HTML fix implemented and tested
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to master branch
- ✅ All tooltips now properly render HTML content
- ✅ Enhanced charts and tooltips system fully functional

## Related Features
